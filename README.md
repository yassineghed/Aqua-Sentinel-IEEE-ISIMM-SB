## Aqua Sentinel  
Autonomous Marine Monitoring System  

"Aqua Sentinel" is an integrated underwater monitoring system designed to support marine conservation, biodiversity assessment and invasive species detection. It combines an underwater camera unit, AI-powered analysis models and the MarineGuard application to deliver actionable insights for researchers, fishermen and coastal communities.

## 🎯 Project Goal
Provide an affordable and autonomous solution to:
- Monitor marine life in real time
- Detect invasive or harmful species
- Track fish populations and growth over time
- Improve coastal community awareness and engagement

## 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Models

### 1. Fish Detection (Model 1)
A YOLO-based model for detecting and classifying marine species from underwater video frames.

### 2. Growth Prediction (Model 2)
A regression-driven model using environmental data and detection outputs to estimate population growth and ecological trends.

Each model folder includes:
- Dataset folder (raw, labeled, processed, samples)
- Training notebook (Colab)
- Requirements file
- Model card
- Documentation
